# Greek Tourism Statistics

This repository contains a Python project developed for a university project. The project's goal is to obtain tourism statistics for Greece and perform some calculations based on them.

The project downloads CSV files from the Greek Statistical Authority website at "[www.statistics.gr/el/statistics/-/publication/STO04/](http://www.statistics.gr/el/statistics/-/publication/STO04/)". These CSV files contain information about the number of visitors, overnight stays, and other relevant data for various regions of Greece.

The project reads these CSV files and performs calculations to obtain various statistics such as the average number of visitors, the average length of stay, and the total revenue generated from tourism.
